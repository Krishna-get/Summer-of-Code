Summer of Science Project , IIT Bombay
downloaded software
made a nand component
made other components and used nand component as library in it
compiled it 
got rtl files from locating the entity
made full adders, full substracture and multiplexers , made their componenents and used it
implemented meely and more design in fsm , here i used meely 
successfully wrote fsm code for the whole machine, component
studied sequence detector in fsm 
created testbench files in the prooject involving registers 
studied the waveforms and verified them working with the code, especially the output,value,clockperiod
week-(1-4)material completed within the tiemeline.
now studying neural network fpga
